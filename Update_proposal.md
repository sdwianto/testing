Updated Proposal — NextGen ERP (Enterprise‑grade, Hybrid, Best‑of‑breed Baseline)

1) Executive Summary
This document supersedes and updates the original “Custom ERP Solution” proposal to reflect a more stable, scalable, and policy‑friendly architecture. The core scope remains the same (Inventory, Procurement, Rental & Maintenance, Finance, HRMS/Payroll, CRM/BI) with a strong **hybrid (online/offline)** operating model and **enterprise‑grade** non‑functional requirements.

**Key changes from the original plan:**
- Real‑time transport is standardized to **Server‑Sent Events (SSE)** with **Redis** for fan‑out and delivery guarantees; WebSockets/Socket.IO are no longer required for app‑level realtime on serverless platforms.
- “Time‑based migration” is replaced by **objective, measurable thresholds** (load, throughput, MAU) to trigger scaling steps.
- A clean **hybrid/offline addendum** clarifies offline capture, conflict resolution, and synchronization—without locking in to CouchDB/PouchDB.
- The stack adopts a **best‑of‑breed baseline** (Neon/Postgres → RDS/Aurora; Upstash Redis → Redis Enterprise) while keeping the code portable via **Prisma** and **SSE/Redis**.

2) Scope Alignment with RFQ
- **Modular ERP**: Inventory, Procurement, Rental & Maintenance, Finance/Accounting, HRMS/Payroll bridge, CRM, and embedded BI.
- **Hybrid operations**: Must work in remote/low‑connectivity sites (field operations), then sync seamlessly when connectivity returns.
- **Open source & extensible**: Full code ownership; modern TypeScript stack; cloud‑agnostic data tier.
- **Audit & security**: SSO/IdP, RBAC, audit log, and data protection.

3) Target Architecture (Best‑of‑breed Baseline)
**Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, React Query.  
**API layer:** Next.js Route Handlers (or a small Node service) with **tRPC** or REST; **Prisma** ORM.  
**Database:** **Postgres (Neon in early stage)** → migratable to **AWS RDS/Aurora**.  
**Cache & Realtime backplane:** **Redis** (Upstash early) → migratable to **Redis Enterprise/ElastiCache**.  
**Realtime (app‑level):** **SSE** channels + **Redis Pub/Sub or Streams** for fan‑out; idempotent delivery per tenant/user.  
**AuthN/AuthZ:** NextAuth + enterprise IdP (OIDC/SAML, e.g., Azure AD/Okta); RBAC in app DB.  
**File/objects:** Cloud object storage (S3‑compatible).  
**Observability:** Sentry (errors), OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs, uptime checks.  
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + environment‑based promotion.

> Why best‑of‑breed now? It maximizes portability and avoids platform lock‑in. The app code remains the same whether the control plane runs on Vercel + managed services or moves to Kubernetes on AWS.

4) Hybrid/Offline Addendum
We support three complementary patterns to satisfy “hybrid” field operations:
1. **Resilient Read‑only Mode** (everywhere): critical datasets cached client‑side (IndexedDB) for basic lookups when offline; automatic refresh when online.
2. **Capture‑and‑Forward** (most forms): user actions are queued locally (IndexedDB) and **replayed** when online; the server enforces version checks and idempotency to prevent duplicates.
3. **Full Offline Packs** (selected flows/devices): for heavy field use (e.g., job cards, inspections, rental hand‑over), we package domain datasets into a local store (e.g., SQLite via a PWA wrapper or IndexedDB with RxDB). Conflict resolution uses **server‑authoritative merge** with record versioning (updated_at + hash) and optional CRDTs for free‑text notes.

**Sync and Conflict Resolution Principles**
- **Server is source of truth**; client changes carry a `base_version`. If server version differs, a merge is attempted; unresolved items are flagged for user review.
- **Idempotency keys** on mutations guarantee at‑least‑once replay safety.
- **Per‑tenant streams** in Redis drive near‑real‑time propagation of accepted changes back to online clients via SSE.

**Why not CouchDB/PouchDB?** The above model avoids replicator complexity and lets us keep Postgres as the single system of record; it’s simpler to operate and scale while still meeting offline RFQ goals.

5) Realtime Design (SSE + Redis)
- **Transport:** SSE (HTTP/1.1 friendly, CDN/proxy‑safe) for event fan‑out to browsers and devices.
- **Backplane:** Redis Pub/Sub (low latency) or Redis Streams (replay & consumer groups) for multi‑instance delivery.
- **Semantics:** Per‑tenant and per‑user channels; **idempotent events** with monotonic cursor; optional backfill from Streams on reconnect.
- **Why SSE?** Works reliably behind serverless/edge platforms, simpler than WebSockets on Vercel/Cloudflare, and needs no sticky sessions.

6) Security & Compliance
- **Authentication:** NextAuth with enterprise IdP (OIDC/SAML), MFA where required.
- **Authorization:** RBAC + row‑level scoping by tenant/site; policy checks in tRPC procedures.
- **Audit:** append‑only audit table; immutable event trail for approvals, financial postings, and admin activity.
- **Data protection:** field‑level encryption where needed; S3 with object‑level policies; backups with PITR.

7) Deployment & Environments
**Stage 1 (Pilot/Small scale):**
- Frontend: Vercel. API: Vercel or a small Node service (Fly.io/Render).
- Data: Neon Postgres, Upstash Redis, S3 compatible storage.
- Observability: Sentry + basic metrics.
- Realtime: SSE via API routes; Redis Pub/Sub.

**Stage 2 (Growth/Standard production):**
- Move API to **AWS ECS/EKS** (or Fly.io Machines), add autoscaling & private networking.
- Postgres → **AWS RDS/Aurora**; Redis → **Redis Enterprise/ElastiCache**.
- Add **Redis Streams** for replay; deploy BI node and background workers (BullMQ).

**Stage 3 (Enterprise):**
- Multi‑AZ databases; cross‑region read replicas.
- Dedicated ingestion gateway for offline sync; WAF & private link to core systems.
- Full observability stack (OTel Collector + Grafana/Loki/Tempo).

8) Implementation Strategy & Commercials
**Cloud‑first (pilot) with objective scaling thresholds**  
- Start on managed services to keep OPEX low and iterate fast.  
- Scale/migrate when any threshold is exceeded (sustained DB CPU > 60%, p95 latency > 300 ms, > 500 concurrent SSE clients, > 50k MAU, etc.).

**Reference cost (pilot, 2025 ballpark):**
- Neon Postgres + storage: $25–100+ /mo
- Upstash Redis: $10–50 /mo
- Vercel/S3/Observability: $20–80 /mo
- **Total:** ~$55–230 /mo, usage‑dependent

**One‑time migration to AWS (when needed):** zero code changes to data access (Prisma) and realtime (SSE/Redis); re‑point connection strings and deploy containers.

9) Roadmap & Milestones (Illustrative)
1. **Inception & Design (2 weeks):** confirm workflows, draft data model, non‑functional requirements.  
2. **Sprint 1 (4–6 weeks):** Inventory + Procurement + Auth/RBAC; baseline SSE channels; initial offline capture.  
3. **Sprint 2 (4–6 weeks):** Rental & Maintenance; Finance foundations (Chart of Accounts, postings); BI skeleton.  
4. **Sprint 3 (4–6 weeks):** HRMS bridge; approvals & audit; conflict resolution UI; observability.  
5. **Pilot & UAT (2–3 weeks):** training, data migration, cut‑over plan.  
6. **Go‑live & Hypercare (4–6 weeks):** SLAs, monitoring, tuning.

10) Success Criteria
- Reliable hybrid operation (no data loss; safe replay).
- p95 API < 300 ms, real‑time fan‑out < 1 s under target load.
- Clean audit trail and role‑safe access.
- Zero‑code migration path from pilot to enterprise infrastructure.

**Notes:** This update aligns with the original intent and scope while adopting a more robust runtime and realtime strategy for modern cloud/serverless platforms. It preserves full code ownership and avoids lock‑in by using Prisma + Postgres and SSE/Redis throughout.
